## Setup
# These are the first things that should be loaded. This is where we set up the
# environment and load anything that is likely to be needed by other modules.
source "${ZDOTDIR}/lib/100-setup.zsh"

## Plugins
# This is where we load all of the plugins. This is done before the modules so
# that the modules can use the plugins.
source "${ZDOTDIR}/lib/200-plugins.zsh"

## Modules
# This isn't really a module system, but rather a way to load different parts of
# the configuration in a more organized way.
# It loads each *.zsh file in the `zmodules` directory in order.
source "${ZDOTDIR}/lib/500-modules.zsh"

## Prompt
# This is where we set up the prompt. This is done last so that the prompt can
# load all the plugins, etc. before the prompt is set. The transient prompt is
# set first so that it can be used while the main prompt is being loaded.
source "${ZDOTDIR}/lib/700-prompt.zsh"

## Post config setup
# Anything that must be loaded after the modules are loaded should be loaded
# here. Useful for stuff that might happen in the background and shouldn't block
# the shell from starting.
source "${ZDOTDIR}/lib/900-post.zsh"
